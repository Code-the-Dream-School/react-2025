# Week-00

## Video 1 of 1: Introducing the Course

### Video Description

#placeholder/video-scripts/description

### Narration

> In this course, you will delve into React, a widely-used UI development library for creating dynamic web applications. Together, we will embark on constructing a to-do list application through our weekly assignments. As we progress, the final two weeks will be dedicated to your ultimate project, where you will apply the skills acquired to tackle real-world React applications.
>
> Let's now take a closer look at the course structure. The Intro to React v3 program comprises 13 weekly lessons and an additional 2 project weeks. Each lesson is designed to build upon the last, emphasizing the importance of following the course sequentially without skipping or falling behind.

> [!suggestion]
> Show the [[Code The Dream/Intro to React V3/Curriculum/Shared/Curriculum Outline|curriculum breakdown by week]] on the screen

> During **Weeks 1-6**, we will lay the groundwork by covering the fundamental aspects of React and guide you in developing a simple application. Transitioning into **Weeks 7-9**, the focus shifts to integrating remote data fetched from and saved to an API. **Week 10** marks the introduction of utilizing CSS to enhance the user interface of your applications.
>
> Moving forward to **Weeks 11-12**, you will learn strategies to effectively manage complex data within your applications. **Week 13** will familiarize you with essential tools and libraries necessary for React development. Finally, **Weeks 14-15** will provide you with dedicated time to work on your project, bringing together all the knowledge and skills acquired throughout the course.
>
> Since materials presented build on previous weeks, it's important that you don't skip lessons or go out of order. One of the main requirement for graduation is that **all weekly assignments must include a link to a that has been reviewed and approved by your assigned reviewer**.

> [!suggestion]
> Navigate a lesson page live while talking about each of the sections

> Each week's page is broken down into 4 sections, **Introduction**, **Discussion**, **Assignment Instructions**, and **References and Further Reading**
>
> The **introduction** will give you information about what you're going to learn that week and how it applies to to the bigger picture.
>
> In the **discussion** portion of each weekly lesson, we will explore each of the listed topics in depth. We will learn key techniques and best practices that developers employ while working with the topics presented. All coding examples are from another project we'll watch come together: CTD's new eCommerce Store : CTD Swag[^1]. No coding for that project is required from you, but if you're interested, a repo for this project can be found in the video description below.
>
> Most of our **weekly assignments** will involve developing a to-do application. A demo of the app can be found here: #placeholder/todo-app-link. Each week you will apply the lesson materials to develop the to-do app until it is complete, functional, and is worthy of a place in your portfolio.
>
> The **assignment instructions** will provide enough details to code out the week's assignment but you will also be given certain tasks to figure out how to accomplish on your own. Balancing written instruction with individual problem solving keeps the course reasonably challenging and a lot more interesting than a list of things to type into your code. Professional developers are expected to engage in problem solving and research while doing their work. Some tasks you will be responsible for may be challenging but are designed to be reasonable for a junior developer to undertake.
>
> Once completed with the weekly lesson instructions, you'll submit a PR of the week's code changes using an assignment submission form linked at the the "Instructions" section. A step-by-step of how to open a PR can be found here: #placeholder/pr-instructions. The assignment submission form also includes open-ended mindset questions that will help you start to think like a professional developers.
>
> A reviewer will look at the PR to approve it or recommend changes. You'll be expected to make any requested changes before starting the next lesson. If you have questions about the review or need any clarifications, use the conversation tools on the PR page and/or Slack to talk with your reviewer. They are there to help you out!
>
> A final note about assignments: there will be a few weeks where you will work with other repos but those will be clearly indicated in the assignment instructions.
>
> The curriculum links to resources in each lesson but these can be difficult to find when scanning through paragraphs of text. Every weekly lesson's page ends with a section that re-lists all of these links and include other useful resources.

> [!suggestion]
> Close out course window and show narrator or some other neutral background.

> The final two weeks of the course will be used to develop a final project. You will demonstrate your React knowledge to make a web application of your own choosing! It will be an opportunity to work on a problem that you find interesting or an idea that sounds like fun. Don't worry at this point if you don't have any project ideas. We will brainstorm some ideas and discuss how to plan our project work before starting on it.
