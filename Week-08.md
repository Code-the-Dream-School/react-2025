# Week-08

## Introduction

### Topics Covered

- Sorting
- Searching

### Lesson Objectives

By the end of this lesson, we will:

#### Objective 1: Sorting

- Implement sort functionality to organize lists that are presented to the user

#### Objective 2: Filtering

- Implement a filtering feature to return desired items to a user

## Discussion Topics

### Sorting

- array.sort
- sorting on single property: `price` OR `popularity` with `<option>`
- sort on 2 properties: `price`, `name`

### Filtering

- array.filter
- filter on single property: `availability` with `<checkbox>`
- filter on multiple properties
	- `availability` with `<checkbox>`

Often times, a remote system will have many more entries than can be displayed comfortably on a single page. Sending everything on a request can take take a while or may even be impossible (think Google search results counts). Next week we will deal with sorting or searching of remote data with fetch requests.
